    /*This code uses a StringBuilder to construct the .ics file as a string. It starts by adding the file header, followed by the event details, and then the file footer. You can customize the event details to include any additional information you need.

    To use this function, you would create an Event object with the details of your event, and then pass it to the generateIcsFile function to generate the .ics file as a string. You can then save this string to a file with the .ics file extension, and the file will be recognized as a valid .ics file.

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

    make a function that downloads a file

    Here is an example of how you could create a function that downloads a file in Kotlin:

    Copy code
*/
    fun downloadFile(url: String, fileName: String) {
        val url = URL(url)
        val con = url.openConnection() as HttpURLConnection
        val inputStream = con.inputStream
        val fileOutputStream = FileOutputStream(fileName)
        inputStream.use { input ->
            fileOutputStream.use { fileOut ->
                input.copyTo(fileOut)
            }
        }
    }

/*

    This function takes a URL and a file name as input, and uses the URL and HttpURLConnection classes to download the file from the given URL. It then uses the FileOutputStream class to save the file to the local file system with the specified file name.

    To use this function, you would simply call it with the URL of the file you want to download and the file name where you want to save it, like this:

    Copy code
*/

    //downloadFile("http://www.example.com/file.zip", "file.zip")

    make function to create and download event.ics file

    Here is an example of how you could create a function that generates and downloads an .ics file in Kotlin:

    Copy code
*/

    fun generateAndDownloadIcsFile(event: Event, fileName: String) {
        // Generate the .ics file as a string
        val icsFile = generateIcsFile(event)
        // Create a temporary file with the specified file name
        val tempFile = File.createTempFile(fileName, ".ics")
        // Write the .ics file contents to the temporary file
        tempFile.writeText(icsFile)
        // Download the temporary file
        downloadFile(tempFile.toURI().toURL().toString(), fileName)
//         Delete the temporary file
        tempFile.delete()
    }
/*

    This function uses the generateIcsFile function from the previous example to generate the .ics file as a string. It then creates a temporary file with the specified file name, writes the .ics file contents to the temporary file, and then uses the downloadFile function from the previous example to download the temporary file. Finally, it deletes the temporary file.

    To use this function, you would create an Event object with the details of your event, and then call the generateAndDownloadIcsFile function with the event and the file name where you want to save the .ics file, like this:

    Copy code
*/
fun test(){
    val event = Event()
    generateAndDownloadIcsFile (event, "event.ics")
}
